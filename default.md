# Introduction

Sean good morning -

I have used the following documents as the basis of this scope of works for a proof of concept (prototype) for your requirements outline:
1. Proposed Business Venture - Draft 1
2. Takemeon business requirements by SK

Because there's a monetary commitment involved I've found it ultra necessary to understand the requirements for the proof of concept as well as to very clearly elucidate what will be delivered in exchange.

I've spent time trawling through current recruitment providers, to better understand the current offerings in the market. The baseline of all the providers seems to be "CV" online with search functionality, which is very much in line with what I'm understanding is the basis for Takmeon.

I take heart from a European centric article [Europeâ€™s budding recruitment tech platforms, compared](https://sifted.eu/articles/recruitment-tech-platforms-compared/) that your goals for Takmeon have potential, particularly in what I see as an over-represented product space. 
However millions of Euros and British Pounds continue to be invested in the very space.



- In a nutshell, what I propose for a proof of concept (prototype) is outlined in this[link](./prototype-proposal). 
- If you were to utilise my company for the development of this prototype, the manner in which we charge is outlined in [the attached](./development-charging.md)


I don't wish to overstep my brief other than to conclude that it won't be whether you develop your own platform or use existing products in the market, your ultimate success will be all about the **quality** of the data that you manage and provide.
