# Introduction

Sean good morning -

I have used the following documents as the basis of this scope of works for a proof of concept (prototype) for your requirements outline:
1. Proposed Business Venture - Draft 1
2. Takemeon business requirements by SK

Because there's a monetary commitment involved I've found it ultra necessary to understand the requirements for the proof of concept as well as to very clearly elucidate what will be delivered in exchange.

I've spent time trawling through current recruitment providers, to better understand the current offerings in the market. The baseline of all the providers seems to be "CV" online with search functionality, which is very much in line with what I'm understanding is the basis for Takmeon.

I take heart from a European centric article [Europeâ€™s budding recruitment tech platforms, compared](https://sifted.eu/articles/recruitment-tech-platforms-compared/) that your goals for Takmeon have potential, particularly in what I see as an over-represented product space. However millions of Euros and British Pounds continue to be invested in the very space.


I don't wish to overstep my brief other than to conclude that it won't be whether you have your own platform or use existing products out in the market, your ultimate success will be all about the quality of the data that you manage and provide.

- In a nutshell, what I propose for a proof of concept (prototype) is outlined in this document: 
- If you were to utilise my company for the development of this prototype, the manner in which I charge is outlined in this outline: 


Your obvious competitive advantage is in the supply of staffing to the Resource Sector

In this time i have tried to get a perspective on your challenge and the plethora of products that play in your xxx space.

However, a very interesting observation is that there is a lot of activity in the HR and XX space with a lot of $ being invested in what I consider a bland over-represented space
I find them all boring and same:same. However, they are garnering no end of interest
here's some links to articles that i'm broadly referring to:


__Platform for resources industry__


Whilst you did not call me in to be a business analyst, my observations are this:
You have two options in terms of moving your business forward terms
utilise of the multitude of products on the market - no development costs required
downside - 
it's always what someone else gives you and you have no control (if that's what you want)
integration with other systems ?

Writing your own product - 
downside - will cost $ and time, do you have both in plentiful supply and


irrespective of which of the above tacts you take, you will only ever be just another 'head hunter'
if you want to stand out in a very crowded market of same, like products you really do need to differentiate and have a jump on the very competent competition and then some

so, in reality the above will provide you a centralised database of all your excel sheets, your napkin notes, your seek CVs, etc...
and, with this you'll bring exactly the same value to your prospects as any of their other multitude of xxx (head-hunters) utilised

What actually is the business you're looking to setup?

> __Niche: Resources Industries__


it's "information", specifically trades, skills and availability (and so is everyone else in the space)
so, how will you exceed?
having a larger database of trades people?
what will actually make you more popular?
cheaper rental of these resources?
quality, up to date information is what i suspect is what you want to have to offered

so, perhaps you should pivot your goals and have the MVP(platform) as your toolset, but your business something totally different.

MVR - minimum viable requirement ?
