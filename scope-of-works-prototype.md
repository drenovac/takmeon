# Scope : "create the world’s largest digital marketplace for recruitment and staffing."

- Employers can find the right personnel to manage projects more efficiently. Workers can easily search for jobs, manage their resume, and schedules. It’s a two-way dynamic marketplace


- OUR SCALABLE PLATFORM CONNECTS EMPLOYERS WITH WORKERS
    - By creating a self-maintaining, live database of workers and giving direct access to employers, 
    - we create significant efficiencies in the job market that we can provide at a fraction of the competition’s cost.

<hr>

- The document "Takmeon Pitch 2020" speaks to a distant future, the immediate requirement is to prototype the dream.
- The goal is to create a prototype suitable to present in front on prospective clients, to fully define a number of smaller MVP stages which can serve as a solid foundation to understand the requirements as well as commitment required to achieve it.

## Scope of Works for Prototype

1. Portal
  - find and recruit the right people
  - speed to find perfect candidates
1. App Engine
1. Search Engine

| Technology as an enabler || **a 101 statement** |
| Clunky manual processe||TODO: a list would be useful to project features, functionality to focus on |
| MVP |Within 8 months of start |Differs to the content of "BS Proposal - Takmeon Development from brad"|
| SKILLS SHORTAGES IN THE TRADES LABOUR MARKET |- Competition for a limited number workers is fierce<br>- Difficult to find the right skills and qualified people<br>- Skilled graduate numbers are decreasing whilst demand for roles increases<br>- No single global view of currently available workers<br>- This makes it difficult and costly for employers to find skilled workers when needed.| |
| HIGH TURNOVER RATES 15-25% |- Often due to a lack of job satisfaction and understanding of employee/employer behaviors<br>- Workers are often placed in a role and location that is unsuitable<br>- Workers move onto the next role before a project ends to get ahead of their peers<br>Spend on replacement recruitment is costly for large scale projects<br>- Human resource delays result in costly project overruns<br>- Leads to a slow and inefficient market|
| TRADITIONAL RECRUITMENT AND STAFFING AGENCIES ARE EXPENSIVE |Margins can be anywhere from 10-25%<br>Databases are often not current<br>The quality of databases are wildly varying<br>Employers have to work with many agencies to fulfill vacancies<br>Recruitment budgets are therefore significantly higher than they need to be |
| LACK OF DIGITAL INTERACTION|Trades workers typically don’t use platforms such as Linkedin<br>Lack of standardisation results in a time-consuming and inefficient recruitment process<br>Typically not digitally organised with certifications and resumes<br>Heavy reliance upon face-to-face interaction and even personal networks<br>This is also why it is so expensive! |
| SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS| Lack of relevance to trades workers<br>Limited screen time available for workers<br>Typical worker has a lack of technology ‘savviness’<br>Social media viewed as just that, social|
| JOB SEARCH SITES|Large volume of unstructured resumes adding significant review time<br>Mostly low quality or unsuitable<br>Long lead times to find suitable trades personnel<br><br>Inefficient due to high frequency of short-term contract work<br>Impractical for recruitment of large numbers of trades workers<br>“ghost” jobs posted to attract trades workers for recruitment agency databases |
| RECRUITMENT AGENCIES |Localised catchment around recruitment office with limited talent pool<br>Databases costly to keep up-to-date (resulting in most of them out of date)<br>Recycling of same workers<br>Most expensive option<br>Too much control with recruiter |

# OUR SOLUTION - Employers
| | | | |
|----|----|---- |---- |
|Save Time|- Instant<br>- direct access to a large<br>- up-to-date<br>- high quality<br>-vetted talent pool |- How?<br>- Everyone will use this portal?<br>- How will we manage this?<br>- As above<br>-As above| TODO: Enter other Q&A | XX|
| Save Money| || Is this a driver given the ++ service being offered?. If the solution is so superior, why cut price?|
| Better Matching|Increased project performance and job satisfaction |
| Greater Access| - To a wider range of skill sets|
| | |

# OUR SOLUTION - Workers
| | | | |
|----|----|---- |---- |
|Save Time|Easy onboarding process and find suitable employers and work, even while sleeping!|
| Look Their best|With resume builder|| Can't image the competition doesn't have this.<br>N2S: this is actually B/S given that we need to skills match - you don't do it against a .pdf resume?<br>perhaps make this a differentitator - Resumes are so "old fashioned, and void of value"|
| Greate Access|To more jobs meaning less time out of work||Perhaps if we're the bees knees of jobs (in this space)|
| Grow Reputation|||This is a piece of data that should reside at the Portal, enabling the portal to be the value proposition between employer and employee|
| | |

# PRODUCT features
|||||
|--|--|--|--|----|
|WORKER SEARCH|- Employers can do a worker search of the live database<br>- and send out a request to multiple candidates of their choice|||
|WORKER STATUS|- The status of the worker is always visible on their screen so it is constantly updated.<br>- This status lets the potential employer know what their current situation is when performing worker searches|||
|POST A JOB|Employers can post a job to the jobs board for free as part of their subscription|||
|DIGITAL SIGN-OFF|Employers can sign-off on timesheets that are submitted through the app with the click of a button||TODO: who is the employer?<br>This is describing a sub-contractor|
|JOBSBOARD|- Workers can search the jobsboard for current listings.<br>-The employers can post jobs for free as part of their subscription,<br> - making it a much cheaper option than jobs websites.|||
|FREE RESUME BUILDER|||TODO: I wouldn't even go there, as per my earlier comments (see above)!|
|CERTIFICATION VAULT|- A digital capturing and storage functionality for certifications that the workers have on record.<br> - A simple share button grants access to potential employers, simplifying existing onboarding processes.|||
|SIMPLE TIMESHEETS|Simple timesheets with digital sign-off provide an instant record of timekeeping, without the inconsistencies that arise from manual timesheets||TODO: Actually has to be anything but. Perhaps simple to use, but it must be powerfull enough to provide any manner of content, the least of which is clock on/off data.|

# Competition

## what makes this solution better than current market leaders?

# Competitive Advantage

|||||
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1ST MOVER ADVANTAGE|The first significant app in the blue collar recruitment industry||TODO: is it?|
|EASE OF USE|Simple user interface, designed for novice users|||
|INCENTIVISED WORKER ENGAGEMENT|Access to a greater number of opportunities, and key features such as free professional resume builder and in-app worksite messaging|||
|GLOBAL TALENT POOL|Employers have direct access to the global talent pool of workers||TODO: what?|
|UP-TO-DATE STATUS|Up-to-date global database of workers showing availability and location|||
|PRE-VETTED WORKERS|Workers are pre-vetted for qualifications and right to work||TODO: sounds like a lot of up-front hard work. Why are we building this portal?|
