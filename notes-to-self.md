# Scratch pad whilst working thru this

|Your Point | Detail   |
|---|---|
|  In app messaging |The only purpose I'd use this for is to broadcast job-availability based upon the filters placed on an employee's profile. <br>If I'm on a 6-week oil platform, what use would I have / need of this app?  |
|Employee Profile|A mechanism to validate / quantify / confirm what an employee posts in the profile. This is to overcome the very issue being had now about the need to filter what's in a CV vs the search field|

# Defining This Project

- There appear to be 3 players in this equation, this piece of software (the Portal), the blue-collar worker (the product), and the customer / employer (consumer).  
- The goal appears to be, to satisfy the consumer with product.  
- What I see as missing from the commentary is a definition of what the Portal's purpose:
  - is it just a dating agency, where introductions are made? Take a cut on the introduction and see you later.
  - a formal labour market, where you can lease your goods? We'll take care of all the issues, such as presentation and fitness for purpose.
  - (TODO: enter something here)

# Prototype vs MVP

TODO: firstly define the differentiator between these 2 terms
TODO: take the docs provided and cut a very quick demo of all the data elements to show what's on the table. This can lead to expanding the discussion so as to get to the 'definition' of what's actually required to get paid.
TODO: once the above step is defined, load the DB with data from 'faker.com' so that there's content on the forms.
