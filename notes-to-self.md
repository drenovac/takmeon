|  In app messaging |The only purpose I'd use this for is to broadcast job-availability based upon the filters placed on an employee's profile. <br>If I'm on a 6-week oil platform, what use would I have / need of this app?  |
|Employee Profile|A mechanism to validate / quantify / confirm what an employee posts in the profile. This is to overcome the very issue being had now about the need to filter what's in a CV vs the search field|

# Defining This Project

- There appear to be 3 players in this equation, this piece of software (the Portal), the blue-collar worker (the product), and the customer / employer (consumer).  
- The goal appears to be, to satisfy the consumer with product.  
- What I see as missing from the commentary is a definition of what the Portal's purpose:
  - is it just a dating agency, where introductions are made? Take a cut on the introduction and see you later.
  - a formal labour market, where you can lease your goods? We'll take care of all the issues, such as presentation and fitness for purpose.
  - (TODO: enter something here)

# Prototype vs MVP

TODO: firstly define the differentiator between these 2 terms
TODO: take the docs provided and cut a very quick demo of all the data elements to show what's on the table. This can lead to expanding the discussion so as to get to the 'definition' of what's actually required to get paid.
TODO: once the above step is defined, load the DB with data from 'faker.com' so that there's content on the forms.

# Hosting of App Engine
The application and data has to be hosted in Australia due to maintenance of personal details.


Prototyping helps us to understand the feasibility of an idea where the MVP is more about validated learning, which is one of the principles of the Lean Startup.

both are product design approaches that are used to validate hypotheses.
A prototype is a sample. It is a taster of what will eventually become a final product. Although, not all prototypes will become a final product.

That is the beauty of prototypes. They are non-committal and can be used in every stage of the design process. Whether it’s about actualizing an idea from your mind or iterating on something already created, prototyping is a powerful way to explore concepts, understand usability and improve functionality

In essence, a prototype is the foundation for what will become the minimum viable product.

MVP is: what is the minimum set of features necessary to engage early adopters and start the learning-feedback loop. It helps entrepreneurs start the process of learning quickly as possible

An MVP is a prototype at its heart but further along in the product development process. An MVP will be created once you have tested out any hypotheses through prototyping and got proof of concept. Ideally, you’ll create the minimum version (which you’ll improve) of your product and share it with the biggest number of people.



A prototype is like a first draft of the product. Not quite a sketch on the back of a napkin (although, by definition, a napkin sketch can be a prototype, and if it will help you to solve your problem it’s perfectly valid!) but definitely a low-engineering, low-functionality item – a kind of clickable trailer for the main feature. A prototype is a way to rapidly test the basic ideas and assumptions behind the product.

In contrast, an MVP is a usable version of the product with just the core feature or features, ideal for testing, resulting in feedback and useful data, yet with a minimum of time and money invested at this stage.


To highlight the differences between a prototype and an MVP:
A prototype tests the idea. An MVP tests the product.
A prototype tests the basic concept; an MVP tests features, treating the basic concept as already proven.
An MVP is functional, it can be used (in however limited a way). A prototype is often more like the visual appearance of the product.
A prototype can be a foundation for the MVP design (in some cases, it makes sense to validate the basic hypotheses using the prototype, and then develop an MVP to progress the work further).

A prototype of an app is an interactive, working visualization of the product, meant to identify usability flaws in design.
A MVP app is the core-value-proposition-wrapped-up-in-essential-features-only version of the product to bring value to the market ASAP.



Unlike a prototype, which conceivably could be a sketch on a napkin, an MVP is always a functioning version of the product. Usually focused on one or two core features, an MVP can be used, tested, played with. You’re not asking theoretical questions of your test group, you’re observing their use of the MVP and gathering specific feedback of a practical nature. However, let’s be clear… an MVP is not just the final product with a few features missing; nor is it an early release version of the final product (though it may well lead to one). An MVP is an experiment, testing part of your solution with the people who are experiencing the problem with the resulting data guiding you to produce a better, more marketable version of the final product.

 If you need to test the basic product concept and you’re working within a very limited budget, create a prototype.

If you want to compare a feature’s performance against what users really want, build an MVP.




In a nutshell, MVP in software development refers to building an app with enough functionality to attract early adopters. As soon as feedback from pioneer users is received, the software development team knows where to improve or iterate the product. Providing the necessary information about the state of your product in short terms is one of the main advantages of minimum viable product.
