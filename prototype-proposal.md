# Proposal for prototype generation


## Introductions

I've spent considerable time re-reading the documents ( a & b ) to come to a proposal on best next steps.
I've canvased the myriad of web sites that provide onboarding features and functionality in order to not re-invent perfectly good working wheels

## Prototype vs MVP (minimum viable product)

Whilst there are multiple definitions of both prototype and MVP, let's agree on the following

### Prototype 
Can be written on back of napkin, can be wire-frames of actual screens, or perhaps a small number of workable web forms.

### Minimum Viable Product
- A first iteration of the completed product, perhaps some actual web forms to traverse so that you can see the proposed operation of the application.
- In the case of the overall Takmeon proposal, the MVP is more like a Minimum Viable Platform, due to the wealth of functionality required to actually run the overall project.

# How this might play out
Below are outlined a number of sample screen layouts to represent the basic processes that the application might have.

These represent the minimum screens we'd require to be able to interrogate the databases as they are being built. The stage I of this prototype will be sufficient enough for internal digestion so that you can decide as to the money committed vs the results produced, as well as to get a sense of usability of the application for your internal use.


## What the application might look like:

### Job Posting Summary
This is a sampler of how your clients might create a project that they're sourcing for. This image represents a listing of all of their current / historical project listings.

### Job Posting Detail
This is an example of how the details of a job posting could look.

- ![New Applicant]()

### New Applicant
The following two screens represent a sample of the data that your XX would collect. This

### Applicant Interview Details
This is intended to be a means where you can create internal notes based on your reading of the CV and / or communications with the prospective candidates.

### Staff Requisition

This screen would detail the specific staff assignment that is being sought.

This would be the main search screen where each data element that is accessible for searching (1) can be filtered by a selection / filter panel on the left.
