Your obvious competitive advantage is in the supply of staffing to the Resource Sector

In this time i have tried to get a perspective on your challenge and the plethora of products that play in your xxx space.

However, a very interesting observation is that there is a lot of activity in the HR and XX space with a lot of $ being invested in what I consider a bland over-represented space
I find them all boring and same:same. However, they are garnering no end of interest
here's some links to articles that i'm broadly referring to:


__Platform for resources industry__


Whilst you did not call me in to be a business analyst, my observations are this:
You have two options in terms of moving your business forward terms
utilise of the multitude of products on the market - no development costs required

if you want to stand out in a very crowded market of same, like products you really do need to differentiate and have a jump on the very competent competition and then some

so, in reality the above will provide you a centralised database of all your excel sheets, your napkin notes, your seek CVs, etc...
and, with this you'll bring exactly the same value to your prospects as any of their other multitude of xxx (head-hunters) utilised

What actually is the business you're looking to setup?

> __Niche: Resources Industries__


it's "information", specifically trades, skills and availability (and so is everyone else in the space)
so, how will you exceed?
having a larger database of trades people?
what will actually make you more popular?
cheaper rental of these resources?
quality, up to date information is what i suspect is what you want to have to offered

so, perhaps you should pivot your goals and have the MVP(platform) as your toolset, but your business something totally different.
