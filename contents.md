# Document Summary


|  Document | Observations   |
|:--- |:--- |
|   |   |
|[Brad Stebbing scope of works & prelim quotation for MVP]|1. One would never host personnel related data off-shore|
|Images Directory|13 sample UI forms wire-framed as to the possible layout and content of necessary forms|
|Business Requirements doc draft - Steve Keast|Excellent document to form the basis of a quick prototype MVP, as long as it's understood that a prototype may be thrown to the trash at any stage.|
|Data Relationship Diagram - Steve Keast|Draft doc ?perhaps? more so defining functionality relationships than data|
|Pitchdeck - Investment Opportunity|Above my pay grade to comment on. <br>However, this ought to be the basis of the scope of works|
|Takmeon Prototype Data Descriptions - Steve Keast||
|App GUI draft workflow|TODO: is this re-inforced by sample wireframes?|
